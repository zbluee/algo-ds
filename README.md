Data Structures and Algorithms
Welcome to the algo-ds repository! This repository is a collection of code samples that cover various data structures and algorithms. It includes implementations of:

- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, and Circular)
- Queues (Array, Linked List, Circular)
- Stacks 
- Trees (Binary, AVL, Red-Black)
- Graphs (Undirected, Directed, Weighted)
In addition to these data structures, various algorithms are also included, such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick, Heap)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary, Interpolation)

This repository is designed to provide you with a comprehensive set of data structures and algorithms implementations that you can use in your projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, you can find useful code snippets here to help you get started with your own projects.

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own file, with comments explaining the logic and functionality. The code is written in Python, but you can easily adapt it to any programming language of your choice.

# How to Use
To use the code samples in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the relevant file. You can then copy the code and use it in your own project. Alternatively, you can import the relevant file as a module and use the code in your own codebase.

# Contributing
